I am an aspiring data programmer with a growing passion for transforming data into insights that drive decision-making. Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science, I am actively building strong foundations in Python programming and data manipulation techniques.
My experience includes working with real-world datasets to perform data wrangling, cleaning, transformation, and visualisation. I enjoy exploring data through code, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and regular expressions to clean and structure messy datasets. I have also applied SQL for querying large datasets and have begun learning about automation in data workflows. In addition to the backend of data preparation, I focus on data exploration and creating meaningful visualisations with tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly. I’ve worked on projects involving customer segmentation through clustering, time series trend analysis, and profit optimisation for retail stores. These projects showcase the end-to-end workflow of a data programming pipeline—from raw data to storytelling through visuals.
I am particularly interested in building automated, efficient, and reusable code for data-driven solutions. My goal is to deepen my skills in scalable data programming, scripting, and working with APIs and large datasets. I’m also working to gain hands-on experience with cloud tools and databases for more advanced data handling.
This portfolio serves as a reflection of my journey so far in data programming, highlighting projects that demonstrate both technical skill and a logical problem-solving mindset. I’m excited about future opportunities to collaborate, contribute, and grow as a data professional.
